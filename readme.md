C++ Menu Project

Basically a cash register, the user is presented with beer choices at a bar and asked for how many beers they want.  The program calculates the total and a tip.  Once the program is exited the running totals are displayed.
Customers get a dollar off if they buy 5+ beers at a time or if the bartender is sad.
