C++ Menu Project

Basically a cash register, the user is presented with beer choices at a bar and asked for how many beers they want.  The program calculates the total and a tip.  Once the program is exited the running totals are displayed.
Customers get a dollar off if they buy 5+ beers at a time or if the bartender is sad.

To run download the file and open the menuProject directory in Terminal.  You can compile the code into an executable file by using:
```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```
'g++'' is the compile command.  'main.cpp' is the c++ source file. '-o' is an 'O' not a zero.  It places the output in a file.  'main' is your executable file.
To then open the program in terminal just type:
```
./main
```
